# Animal Kingdom Critter Simulation

## Overview

This project implements a sophisticated animal simulation system using object-oriented programming principles in Java. The simulation creates a dynamic environment where different animal classes interact based on predefined behavioral rules.

## Project Description

The Animal Kingdom Critter Simulation is a comprehensive software development exercise that demonstrates advanced Java programming techniques. The project involves creating multiple creature classes that operate within a predefined simulation framework.

### Key Features

- Five unique creature classes: Bear, Tiger, WhiteTiger, Giant, and NinjaCat
- Complex behavioral modeling
- Dynamic interaction mechanisms
- Graphical simulation environment

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/minsamat/Sep-2024-MC-O31-ITWM5043-SOFTWARE-DEVELOPMENT
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE

3. Ensure all provided simulation framework files are in the correct directory:
   - Critter.java
   - CritterInfo.java
   - CritterPanel.java
   - CritterModel.java
   - CritterMain.java
   - CritterFrame.java
   - Food.java
   - FlyTrap.java

## Running the Simulation

Navigate to `CritterMain.java` and run the main method to launch the simulation.

### Creature Behaviors

#### Bear
- Alternates between slash and backslash representations
- Color changes based on polar bear status
- Prioritizes infection and wall-following behavior

#### Tiger
- Changes color randomly every three moves
- Displays consistent "TGR" representation
- Complex movement logic

#### WhiteTiger
- Inherits Tiger's movement behaviors
- Always white in color
- Changes representation upon successful infection

#### Giant
- Cycles through textual representations
- Consistent gray color
- Specific movement pattern

#### NinjaCat
- Custom behavior implementation
- Demonstrates creative design approaches
